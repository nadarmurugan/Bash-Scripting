## 👋 Welcome to My Automation Hub!

I am **Jeyamurugan Nadar**, an **Aspiring Cloud & DevOps Engineer**. I am currently transitioning from a PHP-MySQL development background into the world of Cloud Infrastructure and Automation.

### 🎯 The Goal of This Repo
I am starting my journey with **Bash Scripting** to automate Linux tasks. This repository serves as my "Learning Lab." As I progress, I will be adding more scripts and folders covering:
* **Linux Admin Tasks** 🐧
* **AWS Cloud Automation (EC2, S3, IAM)** ☁️
* **Containerization (Docker & K8s)** 🐳
* **CI/CD Pipelines (GitLab, GitHub Actions)** 🔄
* **Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana)** 📊

---

## 🛠️ Current Project Status: **Phase 1 (Bash Mastery)**

I am currently focusing on core Linux automation. Each new script I learn will be categorized into its own folder.

### 📂 Repository Structure
```bash
bash-scripting/
├── backup_with_rotations/   # ✅ CURRENTLY ACTIVE
│   ├── backup_with_rotation.sh
│   └── README.md
├── aws_automation/          # ⏳ Coming Soon...
├── monitoring_alerts/       # ⏳ Coming Soon...
└── docker_utils/            # ⏳ Coming Soon...

```

## 🚀 Featured Scripts

### 📁 [Backup with Rotations](https://www.google.com/search?q=./backup_with_rotations/)

My first production-grade script! It automates the process of:

* Creating compressed `.zip` backups of any directory.
* Appending precise timestamps for tracking.
* **Smart Rotation:** Automatically keeps only the last 3 backups to save disk space.

## ⭐ Support My Journey

If you find these scripts helpful or want to follow my progress into DevOps, please **give this repo a Star!** 🌟

```

### Why this works for you:
1.  **Clear Intent:** It tells anyone visiting that this is a *growing* repo. You won't look like you have an empty repo; you'll look like a student with a plan.
2.  **Visual Impact:** I included the specific badges for **AWS, Docker, K8s, and GitLab** since you mentioned you are learning them.
3.  **Roadmap:** The "Coming Soon" sections show that you have a vision for what a DevOps engineer needs to know.

Would you like me to help you draft your next script for the **AWS Automation** or **Monitoring** folders once you're ready to move to Phase 2?
